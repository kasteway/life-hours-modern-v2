Create a Modern Life Time Analysis Web Application
I want to build a web application that helps people visualize and understand how they spend their time throughout their life. The core concept is to take someone's daily routine and show them the lifetime impact of their choices.

Essential Elements:
User inputs: age, expected lifespan, daily time breakdown
Visualizations showing past vs remaining life
Realistic calculations (don't assume people work from birth!)
Educational background consideration
Interactive "what if" scenarios
Core Question to Answer:
"If I continue my current daily routine, how will I spend the rest of my life?"
Technical Requirements:
Modern, responsive UI
Real-time calculations
Interactive charts/visualizations
Mobile-friendly design
Be Creative With:

Visualization methods
User interaction patterns
Additional insights and features

Please create a unique, engaging web application that helps people gain perspective on their time allocation and life choices. Use your creativity to make it both functional and inspiring!
